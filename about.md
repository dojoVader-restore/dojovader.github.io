### Small details about me
I use to work at Linkeo Web Agencie, a French ICT company in Mauritius Quatre Bornne. Despite being a PHP/JS Developer I am quite versed with C#, Java ( J2ME and Android API, Processing) I try to learn as much as I can. I used to work at Interswitch Group Limited, where I worked on solutions like the Quickteller PayPoint, IFIS Portal and some internal applications, currently I work for Andela where I have been placed with a company called AppRiver; an American company that offers secure cloud-based cybersecurity solutions to protect against phishing, ransomware, conversation hijacking and more. I work with the Next Gen Portal Partner team to build AppRiver solutions for the customers.

My passion actually lies in emulation and C++, it is my long term goal to dabble into this as an hobby.
